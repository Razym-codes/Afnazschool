        <p class="para2">With digital coins this is different. If I have a digital coin and copy mine to your computer, I still have a copy of the coin on my computer. I have to promise to erase my coin when I give you my coin, otherwise that would
          be cheating.</p>

        <p style="width:80%; margin: auto; padding-top: 3.125rem;">To make sure other people don’t think we’re cheating, we’re keeping the score on a big schoolboard with a permanent maker. This marker can never be erased once it has dried, which
          means nobody can ever change the score. This way everybody can see I gave a digital coin to you and didn’t keep mine too. If I ever tried to give my coin to someone else, people could look on the board and see I was cheating.</p>

    <p style="width:80%; margin: auto; padding-top: 3.125rem;">Blockchain is basically a network of computers called nodes which all have same history of transactions. So instead of one company or a database which holds all the information, now the information is spread across whole of the network.</p>
